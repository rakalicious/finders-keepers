# Garbage Collection
## Generational Garbage Collection
- a type of trace-based garbage collection
- can break cyclic references and delete unused objects which are referencing themselves : referenced in [GIL](python-gil.md)
### How
- Python keeps track of every object in memory
- 3 lists are created (Generation 0, 1, 2) when program is run
- Newly created objects are put in the Generation 0 list. A list is created for objects to be discarded. Reference cycles are detected. If an object has no outside references, itâ€™s discarded. The objects that survived this process are put in the Generation 1 list. The same steps are applied to the Generation 1 list. Survivals from the Generation 1 list are put in the Generation 2 list. The objects in the Generation 2 list stay there until the end of the program execution.
